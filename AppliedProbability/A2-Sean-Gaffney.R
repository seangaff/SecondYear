#
#Assume that k cards, numbered from 1 to k, are place on a desk, faced down. You are going to guess
#the numbers on the cards. You would randomly guess the cards by saying numbers between 1 to k.
#Obviously, you would use each number once to guess. Therefore, a guess such 2,2, â€¦, 2 is not
#acceptable!
#For k=6, 7, 8, 9, 10, and using 10,000 random samples, estimate the probability that none of
#the numbers that you guess are correct. Plot the result of probabilities vs. k.
